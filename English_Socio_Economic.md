# Definitions of Socio-Economic Indicators

Lower-Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs)
- LSOAs are small areas designed to be of a similar population size, with an average of approximately
1,500 residents or 650 households. 
- There are 32,844 LSOAs in England. They are a standard
statistical geography and were produced by the Office for National Statistics for the reporting of
small area statistics. 
- LSOAs are referred to as ‘neighbourhoods’ throughout this release.

Barriers to Housing and Services Domain
- The ‘geographical barriers’, which relate to the physical proximity of local services
- The ‘wider barriers’ which includes issues relating to access to housing such as affordability and homelessness. 

The Living Environment Deprivation Domain 
- The ‘indoors’ living environment measures the quality of housing
- The ‘outdoors’ living environment contains measures of air quality and road traffic accidents.

The IMD combines information from the seven domains to produce an overall relative
measure of deprivation. The domains are combined using the following weights:
- Income Deprivation (22.5%)
- Employment Deprivation (22.5%)
- Education, Skills and Training Deprivation (13.5%)
- Health Deprivation and Disability (13.5%)
- Crime (9.3%)
- Barriers to Housing and Services (9.3%)
- Living Environment Deprivation (9.3%)
