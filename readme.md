# UK Land Registry Data Analysis with Socio-Economic Merge

## Project Overview

This project leverages UK Land Registry data, enriching it with socio-economic information by postcode district to uncover insightful correlations and patterns. It involves several key components, including data processing, geospatial merging, analytics with PySpark, and visualization through a Streamlit dashboard, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of property transaction dynamics in relation to socio-economic factors.

## Features

- **Data Processing**: Functions are implemented to clean and prepare the UK Land Registry data for analysis, ensuring quality and consistency.
- **Geospatial Merging**: Utilizes geopandas for merging land registry data with socio-economic data on a postcode district level, enabling spatial analysis of socio-economic impacts on property transactions.
- **PySpark Analytics**: Employs PySpark for efficient processing of large datasets, facilitating complex analytics tasks such as grouping and aggregation by postcode district.
- **Visualization Dashboard**: A Streamlit-based dashboard presents interactive maps and charts, offering users the ability to explore data through various lenses such as price changes, property types, and socio-economic indicators.
