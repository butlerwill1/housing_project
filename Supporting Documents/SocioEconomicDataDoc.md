# Socio-Economic Indicators

[Link to Dataset](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2019)
**This dataset was produced at Lower-Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs), These are significantly smaller than a postcode district like SW11**

- LSOAs are small areas designed to be of a similar population size, with an average of approximately
1,500 residents or 650 households. 
- There are 32,844 LSOAs in England. They are a standard
statistical geography and were produced by the Office for National Statistics for the reporting of
small area statistics. 
- LSOAs are referred to as ‘neighbourhoods’ throughout this release.

- Employment Deprivation (22.5%)
- Education, Skills and Training Deprivation (13.5%)
- Health Deprivation and Disability (13.5%)
